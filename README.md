HELLOOWW!!!!! I'm still learning so im not sure how to set up this properly, but this is a difficult puzzle game i have made :3

If you decide to play this, please dont cheat by looking at the code, i have made it using python and tkinter.


THIS MIGHT SEEM REALLY SCUFFED AND BAD. ALL CRITICISM / FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED.


How to play:

uhh run the code and dont look at it unless ure importing tkinter..

also i am creating this as a for-fun project and so far i have only created 2 puzzles.

they should be difficult enough for you to either give up or spend a couple minutes
